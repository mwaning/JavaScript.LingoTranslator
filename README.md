# JavaScript.LingoTranslator

A tool I made for my work where we use English and Dutch often simultaneously, and there is a lot of specific lingo that can't usually be literally translated, so it's useful to have a customized translator like this.
The database.js file was generated from a tool not made by me which converted a dictionary style Excel file to Json and then to JavaScript.
